Data Dictionary

File name

Row meaning
Each row is one QKD log record representing an observed QKD condition in a realistic setting.
The row is labeled with one of four classes for forensic and machine learning experiments.

Column 1
Name: QBER
Type: float
Meaning: Quantum Bit Error Rate for the observation.
Use: Higher values often indicate disturbance in the quantum channel.

Column 2
Name: photon_count
Type: integer
Meaning: Number of detected photons for the observation.
Use: Abnormal values can indicate loss, manipulation, or detector behavior changes.

Column 3
Name: latency_ms
Type: float
Meaning: Controller or system processing and buffering delay, in milliseconds.
Important note: This is not optical propagation time in fiber.
It reflects overhead such as buffering and error correction related processing.

Column 4
Name: abort_flag
Type: integer
Allowed values: 0 or 1
Meaning: Protocol abort indicator.
0 means no abort condition.
1 means abort condition occurred or was triggered.

Column 5
Name: label
Type: string
Meaning: Class label of the observation.

Label values
normal
Meaning: Normal QKD operation.

partial_intercept_resend
Meaning: Partial intercept-resend behavior where only a fraction of qubits are intercepted and resent.
This can create moderate error and may avoid immediate abort depending on parameters.

detector_blinding
Meaning: Detector blinding style behavior that manipulates detection conditions.
This often affects photon_count and may alter QBER patterns.

fiber_tap
Meaning: Fiber tapping behavior that introduces loss and disturbance.
This can affect QBER and photon_count and may influence abort conditions.

Class balance
Total records: 50,000
Records per class: 12,500
The dataset is balanced to support fair benchmarking.

Design note about feature overlap
Feature distributions overlap across classes by design.
This makes classification more realistic and prevents trivial separation.
